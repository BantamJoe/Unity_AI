# Unity_AI AI Behavior Tree Framework

Create Behavior Trees in C#, No GUI. Preview behavior tree in realtime.
I wanted something that would let me quickly define and create behavior tree nodes how I wanted, something fairly lightweight.
This framework was an attempt to tackle that.

Included is a demo scene BehaviorTest. In the scene is a BehaviorTest prefab.
The prefab has a BehaviorTest (Forgive my naming!) component that gives and example of how to use the framework.
Hitting play will allow you to hit the "Open Behavior Tree Preview" button on the component without errors.

Pending updates:
Preview without having to hit play.
Tree Execution Speed Adjustment (Tree nodes are acted on so quickly it may be hard to debug)
Collapsable Branches
Node Logging
Utility Curve Selectors
